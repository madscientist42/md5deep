The project checked out from the GitHub repository requires CMake 2.6 
or later to build and install.  Building is straightforward- cmake .
in the main project directory will generate a build-system file.  

From there, running the build system should produce a binary set.

From there, running the build system with the "install" option
will pour it onto the system in the "right" place.

Right now, this has been tested on Linux and should allow for cross-
compilation, etc. and work as intended.  There are going to be some 
gaps for what's needed for Solaris, Windows, etc.  Patch submissions
are welcome to handle building up the binaries in the case of 
systems where symlinks aren't produced, etc.
